## Description
    Cotable = Code + Stable (The Paradise of Coder)

   The Android client of Cnblogs that named as "Cotable", the reason why I decided to make this baby is that I want to learn Android development and I like read the blogs at "www.cnblogs.com" as well. I do hope u could join me to make this application better.

## Features
   It can store the cache into you device automatically, so that if you have viewed a blog before, you could view it without the internet connection next time.


## Upgrade Notes
    ### v1.0
    Provide the basic functions like read the lastest blog and latest news and the recommend blogs.


## TODO (wish list)
1. Add the login functions.
2. Make the blogs read by catalogs. (Need web api support, Maybe I will write it depending on Python+Django).
3. View the comment of current blog or news.
4. Post a new blog to the Cnblogs.
5. Add the night read mode.
6. ...
